Its main purpose is to (very) briefly introduce the framework that will be used during the training to people that may not be accustomed to the tools we are relying on. The practical session are extensively relying on the following tools:\n",
    "- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) language,\n",
    "- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) package\n",

    "# Jupyter lab interface TLDR\n",
    "The practical session of the training will be organised as different Python Jupyter notebooks containing one or several exercices related to a specific topic. As you can already see, a notebook acts as a webpage that runs directly into your browser. A notebook is composed of cells, either containing Markdown text (as the one you are currently reading), either composed of Python code. The style of the active cell is depicted at the top-left of the page, as circled in red in the following page header screenshot ![here](img/getting_started_header.png). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both kind of cells can be edited as you want, however, you are not expected to modify Markdown cells during this training (their solely purpose is to guide you during the sessions and you do not want to erase useful information they may embed). On the contrary, you will be asked to implement missing parts of Python functions that will be embedded in `Code` style cells. Let's dig a bit more on what can be done with such cells. All the Python cells can be seen as independent pieces of Python code that can be run independently, while being in the same running environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell contains the most famous example when you start to learn a new language. You can run the code embedded into the cells by clicking the 'play' button (circle in green in the header screenshot). Try it yourself! "
